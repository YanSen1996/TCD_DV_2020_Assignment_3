# TCD_DV_2020_Assignment_3

#### Read the following before running the code, please.

## 1. To view the visualization only
The outputs （i.e. figures and graphs) could be viewed in Assignment-3.html.
## 2. To run the source code:
Clone this repository and install "pyecharts" library through the command below: 
```shell
$ pip install pyecharts
```
Then, run Assignment-3.ipynb through any applications that could deal with notebook file. The charts and graphs would be shown if succeed.
## 3. Interactive:
The functions in source code are all defined with default inputs. That would show the visualization if the user inputs nothing, but inputs are allowed for exploration.
## 4. Libraries used:
In my visualization task, "time" library was used to get the current time, which is used as the default value of the date used for creating the bar chart and the map. "pandas" and "numpy" are used for data pre-processing. The line chart and bar chart are drawn based on “pyplot” in “matplotlib” library. To draw the map, I used “pyecharts” library to generate the positions of countries.
## 5. Database:
The dataset is provided by GitHub user [CSSEGISandData](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData). The dataset could be found [here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
